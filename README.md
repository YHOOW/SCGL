# SCGL 
This package is implementing the method in Neural Networks 2021 paper: 
Incremental multi-view spectral clustering with sparse and connected graph learning. (Please cite this paper)
Please contact 02713@zjhu.edu.cn if you have any questions.

Test_allData.m: U can run this main file, and Its performance will be recorded automatically. 

Thanks a lot for the relevant code provided by Peng Zhou, and this work is inspired by 
Incremental multi-view spectral clustering. Knowledge-Based Systems 2019.
Some of the functions used are from the open source code for this paper Multi-view spectral
clustering via sparse graph learning. Neurocomputing 2020. 

To show my respect for these studies
